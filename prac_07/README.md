# Practical 07
Welcome to my practicals repository for CP1404 (Programming). This repository contains the various practical assignments I have completed as part of my coursework. It includes exercises on software design, clean code practices, and Python programming.

## About Me
I am Doan, a first-year university student studying Computer Science. This repository reflects my ongoing journey to improve my programming skills and follow best practices in software development.
## Key Lessons Learned about Clean Code
- Readability is Key: Writing code that is easy to read and understand is more important than writing code that is overly clever or compact. Clear variable names, consistent formatting, and well-structured code help maintain long-term project readability.

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class and function should have one responsibility. This makes the code modular, easier to understand, and easier to maintain. 

- Avoid Repetition: The DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle is crucial for clean code. Repetitive code leads to errors and makes it harder to maintain. I’ve learned to abstract repetitive logic into functions or classes, making the codebase easier to manage.
